At the age of 15, Samuel Ogunwole was supposed to be preparing for his West African Council Examination (WAEC). But he had to confront a life-0threatening course_ he was diagnosed with right colon cancer.

He would later be saved from untimely death after Gifting Volunteer Network ran a life-saving campaign for him. 

His terrible condition was first confirmed at Faniyet Hospital in Lagos before being transferred to Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), where he was eventually given the final treatment..

In a post-surgical interview with our organization, Mr. Samuel said the sickness started at a fateful night. He said he was whrithing in pain while his mother helplessly watched.

They both had thought it was a mere sickness, perhaphs stomachache, but medical opinion proved otherwise.

“The next day, my mother took me to the hospital and we were stunned that it was beyond what we were thinking about,” he said. 

The doctor told us i was suffering from cancer and my mother  was schocked. We went back home that day.

According to him, a surgery was done at Faniyet Hospital in Ijegun, Lagos. Following this, a 6-seesion of chemotherapy was carried out at LASUTH. 

All these could have not been possible without the aid of the Gifting Volunteer Network who swiftly rescued from the sickness, according to young Samuel.
