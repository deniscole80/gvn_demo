Wealth Doubra Ekiye, a five-year-old boy battling Tetralogy of Fallot, would see the light of the day again because the Gifting Volunteer Network’s donors came to his aid, his father testified.

A medical report signed by Dr Sokunbi, a paediatrician/paediatric cardiologist at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), confirmed the boy’s deteriorating condition.

He disclosed that Ekiye’s case would require a further cardiovascular evaluation either in Nigeria or India.” A possible open heart surgery to correct the baby’s heart defect would also be done which was done in India”, the doctor asserted. 

“He is expected to undergo diagnostic catheterisation and TOF repair.”
After months of failed fund solicitation, the Gigting Volunteer Network at the receipt of the boy’s file case flagged a robust fundraising campaign. The effort did not go unnoticed as the five years old boy underwent a complete surgical treatment at LUTH.

Last year, the father sought financial aid from compassionate Nigerians to save his son from the daring illness. However, testimony coming from him in 2021 denoted his merriment occasioned by the boy’s survival.
