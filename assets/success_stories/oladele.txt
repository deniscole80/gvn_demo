Thank You! Oladele, 22, Walks Again After Suffering Leg Deformity From Birth

There is a sigh of relief for Oladele Owolade,  a 22-year-old student of Social Studies/CRS in Adeyemi College of Education, Ondo State, whose feet deformity had troubled from birth.

Oladele’s mother said her son, from birth, had been facing a physical challenge.  A medical report from Divine Specialist Hospital Complex and Orthopedics Center, Akure Ondo state, Nigeria, said he had presented to the facility since his birth.

It further confirms that Oladele about three years ago developed an infection on his left foot.

The infection was associated with a smelling discharge and severe pain, making it hard for him to walk.

Medical experts at the facility evaluated that his left foot starting from the below-knee would be amputated. Furthermore, he would need prosthetic fillings.

However, financial inability had constrained the facility from carrying out the operation.

Oladele’s mother, who traded in petty things for a pittance was able to raise $200 out of $3000 needed for the operation.

When everything seemed blurry, she ran to Gifting Volunteer Network (GVN), imploring Nigerians to come to her rescue. She explained that Oladele’s peers had tried all they could, but a lot still need to be done.

After a successful campaign spearheaded by GVN, Oladele was successfully operated. He could now walk unhindered, tough with crutches.

In a post-operation video, Oladele could be seen walking out from the facility to demonstrate his ability to work.Thank You! Oladele, 22, Walks Again After Suffering Leg Deformity From Birth
