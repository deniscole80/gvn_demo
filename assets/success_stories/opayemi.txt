Forty-year-old Jimoh Opayemi was gripped by kidney failure in November 2021 and hopes that he would live again were proved abortive despite the intervention by Gifting Volunteer Network (GVN).

Prior to his death, our foundation has raised a part of the money estimated for his surgery at St Nicholas Hospital in Lagos. A report from the hospital revealed that Opayemi is a hypertensive and diabetic patient with end-stage renal disease.
 
Unfortunately,  Opayemi, after a N300,000 intervention by GVN gave up the ghost on January 9, 2022 at Gbagada General Hospital, Lagos. However, Kambien Adepelumi, one of the deceased’s daughters, appreciated GVN’s effort to rescue her father. 

Hitherto, she had pleaded with Nigerians via the GVN platform when her father's illness was fresh.
