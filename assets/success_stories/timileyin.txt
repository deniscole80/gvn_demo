At a tender age, Adeife Timileyin was already going through hurdles of life. He was one year old when bilateral hydrocele disease was detected on him.

Yemilade Aladimehin, the baby’s mother noticed the swelling around his genitals in the fourth month of birth. She discovered a fluid-filled sac around his scrotum. 

A medical report from Arts Diagnostic Centre revealed that there was a sort of excessive bilateral hydrocele with dilation of the left inguinal canal by the fluid.

Yemilade, a single-mother explained that she took to his heels when Timileyin’s illness started.  However, after eight months of suffering, the innocent baby through the aid of our organisation and our kind-hearted partners survived the disease.  He was succesfully treated in June 2021 at the Adenike Fadeyibi Hospital, Ayobo, Lagos.

Giving her testimony, Yemilade sitting with her son, relived her gory experience when Timileyin was batlling with his sickness. “I am single mother. I could not afford the medical bills,” she said. “A friend of mine linked me to Gifting Volunteer Network and i got in touch with them and thankfully, they were able to help me.”

According to her, everything was successful and Timileyin is fine now.  She said the boy has started school and often plays football. This, according to her shows her son is healthy.
