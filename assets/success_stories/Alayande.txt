When Mrs Oluwafunmilola Alayande, 57, was diagnosed with colon-rectal cancer in 2019, her hope of survival was tiny.

Luckily, she would cheat death after a successful surgery in January 2020.

This was followed by a 12-session chemotherapy at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja.

The chemotherapy was successfully done on March 10, 2021. Following this, the woman was discharged from the hospital.

Oluwafunmilola, now hale and healthy, thanked the Gifting Volunteer Network and its donors who made the surgical procedures possible for her to live again.

One of her daughters, Oluwaseyi, extolled the selfless services by the Gifting Volunteer Network.

She also remarked that such a tasking job could have been impossible without the donors contributing to save lives.
