<p>Twenty-three years old federal university of technology, Akure(Futa), Mojeed Adegoke, is in desperate need of N12.5 million for a kidney transplant and other chronic ailments.</p>

<p>Adegoke was an app builder, working for Google.</p> <p>His dream was to be one of the best tech builders in Nigeria and Africa until his dream was botched three years ago when sickness suddenly struck and disoriented him.</p> 

<p>He was said to have been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease in 2021 after he was subjected to severe headaches.</p> <p>This, however, made him put a hold on his final year project at the Federal University of Technology, Akure.</p>

<p<According to ABUAD Multi-System Hospital in Ekiti State, Adegoke had been to their facility on 5th August 2021 with complaints of recurrent headaches and reduction in urine output of eight months duration.</p> 

Examination at presentation, urine and blood tests and ultrasound scan results showed features suggestive of chronic kidney disease possibly secondary to Chronic Glomerulonephritis.

<p>He was discharged to a haemodialysis clinic after sustained clinical improvement to continue thrice-weekly dialysis on an outpatient basis on current medications.</p>

<p>On the projected cost of dialysis for six months, Adegoke would be expected to continue three times weekly hemodialysis among others.</p> 

<p>Speaking to our Organization Officials on his sick bed, Adegoke pleaded with Nigerians to come to his aid.</p> <p>He stated that the sickness has not only snatched my ambition in life," he lamented profusely."It has rendered me vulnerable and depressed."</p>
