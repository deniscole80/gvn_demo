<p>The family of Okeke Chinedu is desperately seeking financial help to save their 10-year-old son, William Chukwuma Chinedu, who requires multiple surgeries worth about N7m ($15,000) to save him from a stroke and a hole in the heart.</p>

<p>Williams, who is currently awaiting surgeries, is said to have spent five months at the hospital until his eventual stroke.</p>

<p>Speaking to our correspondent, the father, Okeke narrated, “My 10-year-old son, Chinedu William Chukwuma, has a hole in the heart, which caused him a brain abscess. He has been in the hospital for five months.</p>

<p>“We started with the University of Benin Teaching Hospital where he spent months. He had a stroke after the sixth week. He can't walk now."</p>

<p>After spending 40 days at the Stroke and Neuro Centre at Owerri, the ailing child was then admitted to the FMC Owerri where he spent three months.</p>

<p>As a result of the stroke, Williams can’t walk and his left hand has become feeble. “According to the doctor, his weak left hand urgently requires surgery to remove the weak bones.”</p>

<p>While noting that little Williams has been scheduled for cardiac cath followed by early surgical VSD closure in Narayana Health in Bangalore India, Okeke lamented. "I don’t have money to take him to India. The estimated cost is about $10 to $15,000.</p>

<p>"Please, I’m seeking your financial support to save my boy. Please help me, I'm a desperate father. Please save my boy," he decried further.</p>
