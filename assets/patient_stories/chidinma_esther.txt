<p>The family of three-year-old Chidinma Esther Michael is soliciting N7 million for a hole-in heart surgery.</p>

<p>Born on October 11th 2020, in the Egbeda area of Lagos, baby Chidinma was said to have fallen critically ill at three weeks old.</p>

<p>It was, however, shocking to the parents when the doctors at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) Idi-Araba confirmed her with a hole in the heart.</p>

<p>The family soon realised that her condition could have been why the mother, Mrs Angela Michael, often fell sick and bled while pregnant with Chidinma.</p>

<p>Speaking with our reporter, Angela decried that Chidinma's case requires surgery. </p>

<p>"My daughter became very sick at three weeks old. My husband and I took her back to the hospital where she was born," she recounted. "The doctors admitted her for some time; then they referred us to Lagos State University Teaching Hospital(LASUTH), Ikeja."</p>

<p>Although Chidinma was placed on oxygen and had a blood transfusion, she couldn't get the test done because her family couldn't raise the bill. </p>

<p>Angela narrated her ordeal. "My husband lost his job when I was three months pregnant due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. </p>

<p>"The bank he was working at laid off some workers. It affected him as well."</p>

<p>Sadly, Angela remembered her delicate pregnancy experience. "During my pregnancy, I would fall sick regularly. </p>

<p>"I would even bleed, which worried my husband and asked me to stop working."</p>

<p>While admitted at LASUTH for one week at age three weeks, "The doctors examined her and told us a test would be conducted on her because of the sound they could hear. </p>

<p>"We couldn't raise the money for the test. So, the hospital discharged us."</p>

<p>"We got home only for her situation to worsen. We rushed her back to LASUTH. We have taken her to different hospitals." </p>

<p>According to the mother, it was at LUTH, through the help of some Nigerians, that the doctors examined her and confirmed a large hole in her heart.</p>

<p>I'm begging every Nigerian to come to the rescue of my child who needs assistance</p>

<p>"The doctor said only surgery can close the hole. N7 million is the bill. That's big money. We don't have that kind of money," she lamented.</p>
