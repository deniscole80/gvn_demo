Baby Ayobami Taiwo was born on the 18th of October with his twin who died on same day. 

2 months early to their expected dated of delivery.  He was born with preterm and with a birth weight of 1.1kg.

Due to the circumstances surrounding his birth, he was admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit and was nursed in an incubator for 31days. During the cause of his treatment he was on oxygen therapy, photo-therapy and blood transfusion.

He was discharged on the 17th of November 2021 and was given a total bill of $1500

Due to the financial constraints on the path of his parents, they were unable to clear the Hospital after a successful Neonatal Intensive Care which accumulated to $3500.

Pls, if you are touched by Baby Ayobami's Story kindly make financial commitment to clear her medical bills at the Hospital
