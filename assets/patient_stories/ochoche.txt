<p>The distraught mother of one-year-old Mofeoluwa Ochoche-Samuel is desperately seeking N7 million for open-heart surgery for multiple holes in the heart.</p>

<p>Baby Mofeoluwa was diagnosed with this heart defect (including a large-sized heart) at six months old.</p>

<p>The medical report from the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) shows she has symptomatic congenital heart disease. </p>

<p>The child's mother, Folakemi Ogunsusi narrated her ordeal to our reporter. "I had her on 17th April 2022. </p>

<p>"Since her birth, she has been breathing fast, constantly sleeping and not eating well. She doesn't cry out loud. It was last September when she started running a fever."</p>

<p>Twenty-five-year-old Folakemi, a single mum, took her baby to Rando Hospital in Lagos, where the doctor discovered Mofeoluwa wasn't breathing well. </p>

<p>Folakemi emphasised: "The doctor admitted her immediately that day, and placed her on oxygen for a month. The hospital advised us to do an x-ray. </p>

<p>"Upon getting the result, they discovered she has a large heart. Immediately, the doctor placed her on heart medications. After a month, the hospital referred us to a cardiologist at LUTH."</p>

<p>After a series of examinations and tests, baby Lois was placed on oxygen at LUTH, where she spent a week and a half. </p>

<p>She lamented: "I'm a Nigerian in a teacher in a private school who earns $13 monthly. I won't be able to meet up savings even if I save my entire salary for three years. I don't want to lose my child."</p>

<p>Mofeoluwa is only a year and five months old now. She isn't growing: she isn't crawling or walking.</p>

<p>Through a Non-profit organization, Gifting Volunteer Network, the mother has called on the public to save her daughter.</p>

<p>The president of Gvn, Mr. Belele David. Tamarau-kuro told our reporter that Grace Mofeoluwa is among the many critical cases his organization has helped through public intervention</p>

<p>"I never thought I would have a child with this kind of health issue," decried Folakemi, a devastated young mum.</p>
