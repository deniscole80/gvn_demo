<p>The family of 14-year-old Cherish Momodu is desperately soliciting N26.440 million to undergo an Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (ATG) and Bone Marrow transplant in Nigeria.</p>

<p>According to her medical report made available to THISDAY, Momodu is managed as a case of aplastic anaemia by the Paediatric Oncology team of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH).</p>

<p>"It was this April we noticed she was having pains after sports, but we didn't ascribe it to this," lamented the patient's mother, Rosemary Onyiye Madu.</p>

<p>She was having muscle pull, so I thought it was due to a lack of exercise. In May, she was diagnosed with this ailment."</p>

<p>The report also stated that Momodu was presented to the clinic due to fever, generalised body weakness for two weeks, bone pain for a week and was severely pale on presentation.</p> 

<p>The report also indicated that the teenager had been transfused severally with blood and blood products since diagnosis and is currently on oral cyclosporine.</p> 

<p>Hence, she requires ATG and a Bone Marrow transplant. The ATG is needed urgently as disease progression is fatal.</p>

<p>According to the report, Cherish needs Apheresis platelets, which are available at the sickle cell foundation at Idi-Ara Lagos.</p>

<p>Cell Tek Healthcare Ltd, where the transplant will be carried out, gave a bill breakdown in a document signed by the Collaborating Medical Director, Prof. Bazuaye G.N.</p>

<p>Hila typing for donor selection costs N360,000 for each of the four samples. Stem cell transplant for Aplastic anaemia and Leukemia cost N25m.</p>

<p>While appealing to well-meaning Nigerians to save her teenage daughter, the last of four children, Rosemary expressed desperation to save her child.</p>

<p>She also thanked the Gifting Volunteer Network for helping them reach the public.</p>

<p>On his part, the President of GVN, Mr David Belele, described Chidinma's case as delicate. "She is among the many critical issues our organisation has helped through public intervention.</p>
